            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hello! My Name is Anthony. I have been programming since I was 15. That was over 23 years ago. I never got too serious about programming until the last few years. After deciding to return to college, I am working on my bachelors in mathematics and statistics, I started taking coding more seriously. I have taken many programming courses in many areas, including: Java, Javascript, web design with html and css, and mysql. I recently got married and at that time I decided that it was time to start working on my portfolio so I can start looking for jobs as a software or web developer. My ultimate goal is to get a masters degree in statistics and go into the data science field, but starting out as a developer will only improve my skills as a data scientist.</p>
